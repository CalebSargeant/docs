Gaining Access
==============

Introduction
------------

Everything is a Computer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two main approaches

Server Side

- Do not require user interaction, all we need is a target IP
- Start with information gathering, find open ports, OS, installed services, and work from there

Client Side

- Require user interaction, such as opening a file, a link
- Information gathering is key here, create a trojan and use social engineering to get the target to run it.

Server Side Attacks
-------------------

- Need an IP Address
- Very simple if target is on the same network (netdiscover or zenmap)
- If target has a domain, then a simple ping will return its IP
- Getting the IP is trickier if the target is a personal computer, might be useless if the target is accessing the internet through a network as the IP will be the router and not the targets, client side attacks are more effective in this case asa reverse connection can be used.

Basic Information Gathering & Exploitation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Try default password
- Services might be mis-configured, such as the "r" service. Ports 512, 513, 514
- Some might even contain a back door!
- Code execution vulnerabilities
