Network Hacking - Detection & Security
--------------------------------------

ARP Spoofing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Why ARP Spoofing is possible:

1. clients accept responses even if they did not send a request
2. Clients trust response without any form of verification
3. Use xarp on Windows and Linux to detect arp poisoning

MITM Attacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Detection:

1. Analysing arp tables
2. Using tools such as Xarp
3. Using wireshark

Problems:

1. Detection is not the same as prevention
2. Only works for ARP Spoofing.

Solution:

- Encrypt traffic
- HTTPS everywhere plugin
- Using a VPN

Benefits of VPN:

- Extra layer of encryption
- More privacy & anonymity
- Bypass censorship
- Protection from hackers

Notes:

- Use reputable VPN
- Avoid free providers
- Make sure they keep no logs
- Use HTTPS everywhere
