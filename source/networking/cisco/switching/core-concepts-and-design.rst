Core Concepts and Design
========================

Plug and play switches
----------------------

* Chance for failure
* Broadcast traffic
* Multicast issues
* Security issues
* MAC flooding

Enterprise Composite Network Model
----------------------------------

* Access
* Distribution
* Core

VLANs
-----

* Simpler Management
* Troubleshooting ease
* Better performance
* Mental sanity
* Summarization points

Designing the Network
---------------------

* Restrict VLANs to switch blocks
* Implement management VLAN
* Separate voice traffic
* Implement multicast support

The Two Flavours of CISCO Switches
----------------------------------

* CISCO catalyst OS (CatOS)

  * Uses set-based syntax
  * Typically combined with IOS for layer 3 functions

* CISCO 'native' IOS

  * Similar to router configuration

* Typically, all larger switch models (such as cat 4500, 6500, etc...) run CatOS
* CISCO has a migration path for all mainline switches to the native IOS
