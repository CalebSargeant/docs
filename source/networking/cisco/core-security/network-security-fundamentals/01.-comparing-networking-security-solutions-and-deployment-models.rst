Comparing Networking Security Solutions & Deployment Models
===========================================================

Cisco SAFE and CVDs
-------------------

Cisco SAFE (Security Architecture for the Enterprise)

-  One of Cisco’s Validated Designs (CVD)
-  Module framework of CVDs

   -  Combine to create a secure architecture

-  Allow the proper design of Cisco security products
-  We’re going to focus on IPS (Firepower) and Firewall (ASA)

Security Control Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Firewalls and Intrusion prevention system work together with other
   products
-  SCF increases visibility and control in a network environment

Defence in Depth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Crucial to the security of a network
-  Device availability and resiliency
-  Regulatory compliance
-  Operational effeciency
-  Auditable implementations
-  Global information sharing and collaboration
-  SAFE allows for modularity and flexibility in design to meet our
   needs

Cisco Validated Designs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Be familiar with CVDs
-  Proven designs to allow products to function the way you want to use
   them
-  Edge connectivity
-  Firewall segmentation
-  IPS
-  VPN Solutions

**Solutions:**

-  Not a one size fits all
-  Every environment is different
-  Apply the designs that are closest to your environment

Architectures
-------------

-  Defence in depth
-  Different CVDs based on your network design
-  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/design-zone.html

**Data Centre:**

-  Firewalls would enforce access policies

   -  Exclude insecure protocols
   -  Protect against internal threats

-  Intrusion prevention systems

   -  Provide deep packet inspection
   -  Cisco Firepower

**WAN Edge:**

-  Firewall to protect WAN Edge

   -  Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)
   -  Firepower Threat Defence (FTD)
   -  IOS Zone Based Firewalls

-  Enforce security policy

   -  Provide inspections at firewall level

**Branch:**

-  Multiple attack vectors
-  VPNs - connect back to enterprise
-  Firewalls - implicit deny
-  IPS

Designing & Deploying Firewall Solutions
----------------------------------------

IOS Zone Based Firewall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Zone Based Firewall running on an IOS device
-  Protects network with security zones
-  Stateful
-  Define zones, assign interfaces to zones, define zone to zone allow
   traffic

   -  Replaces ACLs on each interface

High Availablity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Active/Active:**

-  Two devices can pass traffic at the same time
-  Configurations are replicated
-  Both devices are providing services

**Active/Standby:**

-  Only one (active) firewall is passing the traffic
-  Configs are replicated from active device to standby device
-  If active device fails, standby device would take over role of active

Adaptive Security Appliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Cisco’s firewall workhorse for years
-  Single or multi-context mode
-  Multi-context mode logically divides 1 physical appliance

   -  Each logical ASA is called a security context

-  Only active/active mode is available if using multiple contexts
-  ASA Cluster

   -  Group multiple ASAs together into one logical device

      -  Easier management
      -  Better throughput
      -  Better redundancy - shared workload

Transparent vs Routed Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Routed Mode:**

-  Firewall is next routing hop
-  Either default gateway
-  Or visible layer 3 hop in the packets

**Transparent mode:**

-  Layer 2 device
-  Only a bump in the wire

VPN Termination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  VPNs are in most organizations

   -  Will determine where ASAs of FTD are placed in the network

   -  Place firewall close to the border

      OR

   -  Have a separate set of dedicated for VPN termination

-  Firepower threat defense can be the firewall solution

Designing & Deploying IPS Solutions
-----------------------------------

Firepower features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Analytics and automated defense against threats
-  URL Filtering
-  Malware protection
-  Network profiling
-  Identity-based policies and control
-  Application visibility and control

Firepower Module in an ASA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Provides IPS/IDS functionality to an ASA
-  Next Generation IPS

   -  ASA FirePOWER Services

-  CVDs will help determine where to place ASA with FirePOWER Services

Next Generation IPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Defense in depth
-  Deploy sensors throughout the network
-  Allows us to protect critical systems, not just the border

Firepower Threat Defence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Many firewall features from the ASA, as well as Firepower IPS
   features

   -  Deep packet inspection
   -  Malware protection
   -  Firewall features
   -  VPN termination

-  Not all ASA features are available on FTD yet

Managing Firepower
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Firepower Device Manager (FDM)

   -  On board management of a single FTD
   -  Smaller, less complex deployments
   -  Less analytics and configuration options

-  Firepower Management Center (FMC)

   -  Manage multiple firepowers

      -  FTD
      -  Firepower sensors
      -  FirePOWER services on an ASA

   -  Analytics
   -  Security Intelligence
   -  Correlation tools for the threats

Firepower High Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Firepower and FMC can be configured for Active/Standby
-  FTD devices can be deployed in a cluster
-  Multitenancy (similar to multi-context mode)

Additional Integrations for Firepower and ASAs
----------------------------------------------

REST APIs
~~~~~~~~~

-  Create custom programs or scripts to gain context or control FTD or
   ASA

pxGrid
~~~~~~

-  Platform Exchange Grid (pxGrid)

   -  Used in almost all of Cisco’s security products
   -  ISE is needed to run pxGrid

-  Rapid Threat Containment

   -  Create policy based on user information
   -  dynamically shut down hosts

Cisco Threat Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Cloud Offering

   -  Detect, investigate, analyse and respond to threats

Authentication Integrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Use Cisco ISE to authenticate management administrators and VPN users
