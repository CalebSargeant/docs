Configuring Wireless LAN Controller Device Hardening Methods
============================================================

Wireless Security Overview
--------------------------

Why Wireless Security Is Needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Malicious attacker doesn’t need physical access to cable
-  Can listen if they are within distance of wireless signal
-  Additional security measures are needed

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Password required before device allowed on network
-  24 bit initialization vector (IV and RC4
-  IV was too short and insecure

Wifi Protected Access (WPA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  48-bit IV & TKIP
-  Message Integrity Check
-  Sequence counter

WPA2
~~~~

-  IEEE 802.11i
-  AES-128 & Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol
   (CCMP)
-  WPA2 Enterprise

   -  Uses 802.1X
   -  Authentication occurs at AAA server

-  WPA2 Personal

   -  Use Pre-Shared-Key as authentication

Adding Encryption to Wireless LANS
