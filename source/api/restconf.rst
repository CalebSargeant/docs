RESTCONF
########

RESTCONF is a RESTAPI protocol for the network and is a standard protocol from the IETF (natural evolution of SNMP & MIBs is where you get NETCONF & YANG from)

RESTCONF is newer than NETCONF and most devices will support NETCONF. Both models have their use cases, we must know both.


GRPC is a google protocol where you are able to control & configure everything GCP. GRPC is used in model-driven telemetry / streaming telemetry. Instead of polling device, setup a connection stream to device.
