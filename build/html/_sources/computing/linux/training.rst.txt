What is Linux?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Operating System which sites in the middle of your hardware and users

Unix vs Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Unix was first developed for multi-user and multi-tasking in mid 1970 in Bell Labs by ATT. GE and MIT
- Then linux was born in 1991 by Linus Torvalds
- Linux is mostly free
- Linux is open source
- Unix is mostly used by Sun as Solaris, HP-UX, AIX etc.
- Linux is used by developer communuty or companies (Redhat, CentOs, Debian) etc.
- Unix comparitively supports very few File systems
- Linux can be installed on a wide variety of computer hardware, ranging from mobile phones, tablets, video game consoles, to mainframes and supercomputers

Linux Users
^^^^^^^^^^^

- US Government Agencies (National, State, Federal, and International)
- NASA
- Health Care
- Bullet trains in Japan runs at the soeed of 150-215m/h
- Traffic Control
- Financial Institutes eg NYSE
- Entertainment industries (cinemas, production houses, etc.)
- World e-commerce leaders, including Amazon, eBay, PayPal, and Walmart
- Other fortune 500 companies eg Google, IBM, McDonalds, Facebook etc.

System Access and File System
-----------------------------

Network Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Centos/RHEL 5 or 6 was `ifconfig`
- Centos/RHEL 7 is `ip`
- Centos/RHEL 7.5 and up `ifconfig` has been deprecated
- To use ifconfig in 7.5 use `yum install net-tools`

Important Things
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Linux has super user account called root

    - root is the most powerful account that can create, modify, delete accounts and make changes to system configuration files

- Linux is case-sensitive

    - ABC is not the same as abc

- Avoid using spaces when creating files and directories
- Linux kernal is not an OS. It's a small software within linux OS that takes commands from users and pass them to system hardware or peripherals
- Linux is mostly CLI not GUI
- Linux is very flexible as compared to other OSs

Linux File System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- OS store data on disk drives using a structure called filesystem, consisting of files, directories, and the information needed to access and locate them
- There are many different types of filesystems. In general improvements have been made to filesystems with new releases of OS and each new FS has been given a different name. Eg. ext3, ext4, XFS, NTFS, FAT etc.
- Linux filesystems store info in a hierarchy of dirs and fiels.

File System Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: _images/linux-file-system-structure.png

File System Structure and its Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- /boot - contains file that is used by the boot loader (grub.cfg)
- /root - root user home directory. It is not the same as /
- /dev - system devices (eg. disk cdrom speakers flash drive keyboard)
- /etc - configuration files
- /bin > / usr/bin - everyday user commands
- /sbin > /usr/sbin - system/filesystem commands
- /opt - optional addon applications (not part of OS apps)
- /proc - running processes (only exist in memory)
- /lib > usr/lib - C programming library needed by commands and apps (`strace -e open pwd`)
- /tmp - dir for temp files
- /home - dir for users
- /var - system logs
- /run - system daemons that start very early (eg. systemd and udev) to store runtime files like PID files
- /mnt - to mount external filesystem (eg. NFS)
- /media - for cdrom mounts

File System Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- When navigating a UNIX filesystem, there are a few important commands

    - `cd` - stands for change directory. It is the primary command for moving you arount the filesystem
    - `pwd` - stands for print working directory. It tells you where you current location is.
    - `ls` - stands for list. It lists all the directories/files within a current working dir

What is Root?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- There are 3 types of root on a Linux system

    - Root account: root is an account or username on Linux machine and is the most powerful account which has access to all commands and files
    - Root as /: the very first dir of Linux also referred as root directory
    - Root home directory: the root user account also has a dir located in /root which is called root home dir

File System Paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- There are two paths to navigate to a filesystem

    - Absolute path
    - Relative path

- An absolute path always begins with a `/`. This indicates that the path starts at the root directory. An example of an absolute path is `cd /var/log/samba`
- A relative path does not begin with a `/`. It identifies a location relative to your current position. An example of a relative path is `cd /var` and `cd log` `cd samba`

Directory Listing Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: _images/linux-directory-listing-attributes.png

Creating Files and Directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Creating files

    - touch
    - cp
    - vi

- Creating directories

    - mkdir

Copying Directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Command to copy a directory

    - `cp`

- To copy a directory on Linux, you have to execute the `cp` command with the `-R` option for recursive and specify the source and destination directories to be copied

    - `cp -R <source_folder> <destination_folder>`

Linux File Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+--------------+------------------------------+
| File Symbol  | Meaning                      |
+==============+==============================+
| dash         | Regular file                 |
| d            | Directory                    |
| l            | link                         |
| c            | Special file or device file  |
| s            | socket                       |
| p            | Named pipe                   |
| b            | Block device                 |
+--------------+------------------------------+

Finding Files and Directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Two main commands are useful to find files/directories

    - `find` (`find . -name "test"`)
    - `locate` (`locate test`)

- If `locate` command doesnt output any result, then as rute run `updatedb`
- Also make sure you have `mlocate` package installed
- To check run `rpm -qa | grep mlocate`
- To install run `yum install mlocate`

Difference Between find and locate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `locate` uses a prebuilt database, which should be regularly updated, while `find` iterates over a filesystem to locate files. Thus, locate is much faster than find, but can be inaccurate if the database (can be seen as a cache) is not updated
- To update the locate database run `updatedb`

Changing Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You should change your initial password as soon as you login
- Command = `passwd userid`

Wildcards
^^^^^^^^^

A wildcard is a character that can be used as a substitute for any of a class of characters in a search

- `*` represents zero or more characters
- `?` represents a single character
- `[]` represents a range of characters (`ls -ltr *[cd]*`)
- `{}` range of fiels to create
- backslash as an escape character
- `^` the beginning of a line
- `$` the end of a line

Soft and Hard Links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- inode = Pointer or number of a file on the hard disk
- Soft Link = Link will be removed if file is removed or renamed
- Hard Link = Deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link

    - `ln` (hard link)
    - `ln -s` (soft link)

.. image:: _images/linux-soft-and-hard-links.png

- Note: you cannot create a soft or hard link within the same directory with the smae name.
- Hard links only work within the same partition

Fundamentals
------------

Commands Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Command options and arguments

    - Commands typically have the syntax:
    
        - command options arguments

- Options

    - Modify the way that a command works
    - Usually oly consist of a hyphen or dash followed by a single letter
    - Some commands accept multiple options which can usually be grouoped together after a single hypghen

- Arguments:

    - Most commands are used together with one or more arguments
    - Some commands assume a default argument if none is supplied
    - Arguments are optional for some commands and required by others

File Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- UNIX is a multi-user system. Every file and directory in your account can be protected from or made accessible to other users by changing its access permissions. Every user has responsibility for controlling access to their files.
- Permissions for a file or directory may be restricted to by types
- There are 3 types of permissions

    - r - read
    - w - write
    - x - execute (running a program)

- Each permission (rwx) can be controlled at three levels

    - u - user (yourself)
    - g - group (can be people in the same project)
    - o - other (everyone in the system)

- File or Directory permission can be displayed by running `ls -l` command

    - -rwxrwxrwx

- Command to change permission

    - `chmod`

- Remove read rights from group: `chmod g-r file`
- Remove read rights from all (other): `chmod a-r file`
- Remove write rights from user: `chmod u-w file`
- Add read and write rights to user on file: `chmod u+rw file`

File Permissions using Numeric Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Permission to a file and directory can be assigned numerically

    - `chmod ugo+r file`
    - or `chmod 444 file`

.. image:: _images/linux-file-system-permissions.png

- The table below assigns numbers to permissions types

+---------+------------------------+---------+
| Number  | Permission Type        | Symbol  |
+=========+========================+=========+
| 0       | No Permission          | ---     |
| 1       | Execute                | --x     |
| 2       | Write                  | -w-     |
| 3       | Execute + Write        | -wx     |
| 4       | Read                   | r--     |
| 5       | Read + Execute         | r-x     |
| 6       | Read + Write           | rw-     |
| 7       | Read +Write + Execute  | rwx     |
+---------+------------------------+---------+

- `chmod 764 file`:

.. image:: _images/linux-file-system-permissions-2.png

File Ownership
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- There are 2 owners of a file or directory

    - User and group

- Command to change file ownership

    - chown and chgrp
    
        - chown changes the ownership of a file
        - chgrp changes the group ownership of a file

- Recursive ownership change option (cascade)

    - -R

Access Control List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- What is ACL?

    - Access control list (ACL) provides an additional, more flexible permission mechanism for file systems. It is designed to assist with UNIX file permissions. ACL allows you to give permissions for any user or group to any disc resource.

- Use of ACL:

    - Think of a scenario in which a particular user is not a member of a group created by you but you still want to give some read or write access, how can you do it without making user a member of a group, here comes in picture ACL, CAL helps us to do this trick.
    - Basically, ACLs are used to make a flexible permission mechanism in Linux.
    - From Linux man pages, ACLs are used to define more fine-granied discretionary access rights for files and directories
    - Commands to assign and remove ACL permissions are:

        - `setfacl` and `getfacl`

- List of commands for setting up ACL:

    - to add permission for a user (`setfacl -m u:user:rwx /path/to/file`)
    - to add permissions for a group (`setfacl -m g:group:rw /path/to/file`)
    - to allow all files or directories to inherit ACL entries from the directory it is within (`setfacl -Rm "entry" /'path/to/dir'`)
    - To remove a specific entry (`setfacl -x u:user /path/to/file` (for a specific user))
    - To remove all entries (`setfacl -b path/to/file` (for all users))
    - Note:

        - As you assign the ACL permission to a file/directory it adds + sign at the end of the permission
        - Setting w permission with ACL does not allow to remove a file

Help Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- There are 3 types of help commands

    - `whatis` command
    - command `--help`
    - `man` command

Tab Completion and Up Arrow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Hitting TAB key completes the available commands, files, or directories

    - `chm TAB`
    - `ls j<TAB>`
    - `cd Des<TAB>`

- Hitting up arrow key on the keyboard returns the last command run

Adding Text to Files (Redirects)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- 3 Simple ways to add text to a file

    - vi
    - Redirect command output > or >>
    - echo > or >>

Input and Output Redirects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- There are 3 redirects in Linux

    - Standard input (stdin) and it has file descriptor number as 0
    - Standard output (stdout) and it has file descriptor number 1
    - Standard error (stderr) and it has file descriptor number as 2

- Output (stdout) -1

    - By default when running a command its output goes to the terminal
    - The output of a command can be routed to a file using > symbol

        - eg. `ls -l > listings`
        - `pwd > findpath`
    
    - If using the same file for additional output or to append to the same file then use >>

        - eg. `ls -la >> listings`
        - `echo "Hello World" >> findpath`

- Input (stdin) -0

    - Input is used when feeding file contents to a file

        - eg. `cat < listings` 
        - `mail -s "office memo" contact@calebsargeant.com < momoletter`

- Error (stderr) - 2

    - When a command is executed we use a keyboard and that is also considered (stdin -0)
    - That command output goes on the monitor that outpit is (stdout -1)
    - If the command produced any error on the screen then it is considered (stderr -2)

        - We cna use redirects to route errors from the screen

            - eg. `ls -l /root 2> errorfile`
            - `telnet localhost 2> errorfile`

Standard Output to a File (tee)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `tee` command is used to store and view (both at the same time) the output of any command
- The command is named after the T-splitter used in plumbing. It basically breaks the output of a program so that it can be both displated and saved in a file. It does both the tasks simultaneously, copies the result into the specified file or variables and also displays the result.
- Remember `-a` appends

Pipes
^^^^^

- A pipe is used by the shell to connec the output of one command directly to the inout of another file
- The symbol for a pipe is the vertical bar (`|`). The command syntax is:

    - command 1 [arguments] | command2 [arguments]

File Maintenance Commands

Awk
^^^

- awk is a utility/language designed for data extraction. Most of the time it is used to extract fields from a file or from an output.
- `awk --version` - check version
- `awk '{print $1}' file` - list 1st field from a file
- `ls -l | awk '{print $1,$3}'` - list 1st and 3rd field of ls -l output

- `awk '/Jerry/ {print}' file` - search for a specific word
- `awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd` - output only 1st field of /etc/passwd
- `echo "Hello Tom" | awk '{$2="Adam"; print $0}'` - replace words field words
- `cat file | awk '{$2="Caleb"; print $0}'` - replace words field words
- `awk 'length($0) > 15' file` - get lines that more that 15 byte size

- `sort file | uniq -c` - sort first then uniq and list count
- `sort file | uniq -d` - only show repeated lines

Wc
^^^

- What is wc command?

    - The command reads either standard input or a list of files and generates: newline count, word count, and byte count

Combining and Splitting Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Multiple files can be combined into one and
- One file can be split into multiple files

    - `cat file1 file2 file3 > file4`
    - `split file4`
    - e.g. `split -l 300 file.txt childfile` - split file.txt into 300 lines per file and output to childfileaa, childfileab, and childfileac

Linux System Administration
---------------------------

Linux File Editor (vi)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- A text editor is a program which enables you to create and manipulate data (text) in a Linux file
- There are several standard text editors available on most Linux systems

    - `vi` - Visual editor
    - `ed` - Standard line editor
    - `ex` - Extended line editor
    - `emacs` - A full screen editor
    - `pico` - Begginers editor
    - `vim` - Advanced version of vi

- Our editor = vi (available in almost every Linux distribution)
- vi supplies commands for:

    - inserting and deleting text
    - replacing text
    - moving around the file
    - finding and substituting strings
    - cutting and pasting text

- Most common keys:

    - i - insert
    - Esc - escape out of any mode
    - r - replace
    - d - delete
    - :q! - quit without savinbg
    - :wq! - quit and save

Difference Between vi and vim Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- As far as functionality is concerned, both editors work in the same manner. Which editor you choose is a matter of personal choice. Some people recommend learningh the vim editor instead of the vi editor. Due to added features, learning and using vim editor is much easier than the vi editor.
- Since vim is based on the vi, when you will learn how to use the vim editor, you will automaticall learn how to use the vi editor
- vim has all the features as vi with some excellent addition
- There's also a comprehensive help system and lots of customization options available.

.. image:: _images/linux-vi-vs-vim.png

- There are many websites taht offer free vim interactive training

    - https://www.openvim.com
    - http://www.vimgenius.com
    - https://vim-adventures.com (games)

Sed Command
^^^^^^^^^^^
