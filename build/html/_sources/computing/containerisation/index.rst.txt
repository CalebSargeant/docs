Containerisation
================

A container is more closely related to an executable than it is to a virtual machine, because everything needed to run the application code and everything else the application needs is packaged together.

Although containerisation strips everything down to the bare-minimum needed for an application to run and is called the next evolution in virtual machines, it's more than that. Each container is actually called a process and runs as an executable. A container is, therefore, not a virtual machine.

Docker alternatives:

* lxc containers
* rkt rocket containers (Core OS)

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 4
  :glob:

  *
