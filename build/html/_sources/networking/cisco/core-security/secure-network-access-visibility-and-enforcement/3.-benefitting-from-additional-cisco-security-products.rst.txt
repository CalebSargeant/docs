-  Group: Compares entity/host to similar ones
-  Role: Categorizes role based on traffic seen
-  Rule: Detects when policies are violated
-  Consistency: When a device veers heavily from the baseline/normal
   behavior

Cognitive Threat Analytics and Encrypted Traffic Analytics
----------------------------------------------------------

Cognitive Threat Analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  CTA for short
-  Uses machine learning and data sharing
-  Analyzes network and endpoint telemetry
-  Correlates your activity with known threats
-  Provides risk assessment for threats
-  cognitive.cisco.com

Encrypted Traffic Analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ETA for short
-  Analyzes encrypted traffic
-  Doesn’t need to decrypt packets
-  Helps with compliance
-  See what cipher suites are being used

**What You Need Far ETA**

-  Network device capable of enhanced NetFlow
-  Internet connection for Stealthwatch
-  CTA/ETA turned on
-  Enhanced NetFlow, which is sent to the Flow Collector and contains
   metadata and packet stream information.

Cisco PxGrid
------------

Provides a unified framework that enables ecosystem partners to
integrate with, then share context either unidirectionally or
bidirectionally without the need to adopt special APIs.

pxGrid Ecosystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ISE is the brain behind Cisco’s pxGrid implementation!
-  Subscribers and publishers
-  No changing the data format
-  Information can be consumed by all desired subscribers

Adaptive Network Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ISE capability that uses special policies to restrict or allow access
   on the network
-  Quarantine policy as an example; cut off access via RADIUS CoA for
   endpoint or user in question
-  Do not need to change overall network policies to enforce!

Rapid Threat Containment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Provides additional automation for discovering and mitigating threats
-  Learn, Detect, Respond, Contain
-  Uses CVSS and STIX standards

Cisco Umbrella Investigate
--------------------------

Helps fill the gaps left by other security technologies

What Does It Do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Gives you risk scores, request patterns, domain context information,
   key events, and more
-  Looks for relationships between the malware, domains, IP addresses,
   networks, and more

Guilt?
~~~~~~

-  Guilt by association
-  Guilt by inference
-  Patterns of guilt
