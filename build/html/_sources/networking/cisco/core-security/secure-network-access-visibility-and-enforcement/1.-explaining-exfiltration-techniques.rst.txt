1. Explaining Exfiltration Techniques
=====================================

Exfiltrating Data Using DNS, NTP, ICMP, or IRC
----------------------------------------------

DNS Tunneling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  DNS resolves hostnames to IP addresses
-  Usually uses port 53
-  Infect a computer
-  Resolve DNS for attacker’s website
-  Local DNS server will forward DNS queries to attacker’s DNS
-  DNS Queries contain sensitive data
-  Smaller queries in order to transport large amounts of data
-  Attacker now has the compromised data

**Cisco’s Umbrella** \* DNS attacks are becoming difficult for NGFW and
NGIPS to detect \* 200 billion daily DNS requests \* Large data set of
malicious DNS servers \* Organizations would forward DNS requests to
Umbrella \* Malicious queries won’t be forwarded

NTP Covert Channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Initiation pattern known by malicious server and client

   -  NTP request gets sent to malicious server from client
   -  NTP Response & int. pattern gets sent to client

-  Malicious client will generate NTP request including the int. pattern

   -  NTP Request & Int. Pattern from malicious client

-  NTP Server will begin encoding data in its NTP responses

   -  NTP Response & encoded data to malicious client

-  Even legitimate NTP responses will contain encoded data

   -  Malicious client then sees:

      -  NTP Response & int. pattern to client
      -  NTP Request from client

ICMP Echo Manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Input data into payload of ICMP echo requests
-  Segment data over multiple echo requests

   -  Larger sized echoes are suspicious

-  Server receiving echo requests will place data back together

   -  May send an ICMP echo reply

-  Inspect ICMP payload using deep packet inspection

Internet Relay Chat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Client will authenticate with malicious server
-  Data will flow between the two parties
-  Block all IRC traffic or:
-  Whitelist only specific IRC servers

Exfiltrating Data Using HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, SSH, or SCP
-----------------------------------------------------

HTTPs
~~~~~

**Problems** \* Exfiltrate data over encrypted TLS session \* Send data
to cloud file hosting

**Solutions** \* Decrypt the data and implement DLP \* Use Cognitive
Threat Analytics

FTP SFTP SCP
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Designed to transfer files
-  SFTP and SCP are both encrypted
-  Makes detection even harder
-  Mitigation techniques

   -  Implement SSH decryption
   -  Deny SSH to outside hosts
   -  WSA and Umbrella

Exfiltrating Data Using Email
-----------------------------

-  Disgruntled employee
-  Sends emails that contain data
-  Attacker compromises computers

   -  Auto forwarding rule
   -  Manipulate the SMTP protocol as well

Email Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Email Security Appliance (ESA)
-  Cisco Email Security (CES)
