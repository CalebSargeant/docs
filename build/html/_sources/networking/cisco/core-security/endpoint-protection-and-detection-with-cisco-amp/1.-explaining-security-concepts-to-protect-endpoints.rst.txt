1. Explaining Security Concepts to Protect Endpoints
====================================================

Antivirus & Dynamic File Analysis
---------------------------------

Why Endpoints Need Protected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Defense in-depth
-  Endpoints contain sensitive information

   -  They now leave the protected network infrastructure

Computer Viruses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Attach themselves to otherwise benign files or programs
-  Lay dormant until file or program is executed

Antivirus
~~~~~~~~~

-  Create signatures to identify viruses

   -  Analyzed known viruses
   -  Without a signature, antivirus won’t detect a virus

-  Malicious actors slightly change the virus so a new signature needs
   to be created
-  Required scanning of the endpoint

Heuristics
~~~~~~~~~~

Looks at the behavior of the software rather than a predefined
signature.

Machine Learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dynamically creates algorithms and finds patterns based on large sets of
both malicious files and benign files.

Cisco AMP for Endpoints Overview
--------------------------------

Cisco AMP Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Heavy lifting is done in the cloud and not on the endpoint
-  Quickly integrate to other security products
-  Connectors communicate to the Cisco AMP cloud

Cisco AMP’s Engines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uses a file’s SHA-256 hash to quickly determine if it has been seen and
if it is malicious

Ethos
^^^^^

Looks at the different artifacts of the file, rather than the entire
file itself

Spero
^^^^^

Uses machine learning in order to find patterns to determine malicious
files from benign files

TETRA
^^^^^

Provides antimalware capabilities when the device is not connected to
the cloud

Additional Cisco AMP Benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Evaluate indicators of compromise (IOCs)

   -  Anomalies that could mean a compromise

-  AMP can protect endpoints in real time
-  Dynamic analysis

   -  Execute that file in a sandbox

-  Exploit prevention

   -  AMP moves the location RAM that the program is running

Cisco AMP Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Hash of file is used to determine if it has been seen
-  If it has been seen, previous verdict is used
-  AMPs engines, IOCs, & dynamic analysis are used
-  AMP will update the rest of the security suite of the new threat

Retrospective Security
----------------------

Go back in time and see which endpoints the malicious file has touched.

Device Trajectory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Determine every interaction between the malicious file and other files
on the endpoint.

AMP can dynamically create rules based on the events that occurred.

Endpoint Protection Platform & Endpoint Detection and Response
--------------------------------------------------------------

EPP vs EDR
~~~~~~~~~~

============================= ===============================
Endpoint Protection Platform  Endpoint Detection & Response
============================= ===============================
Known threats are not allowed Retroactively find malware
Machine learning & big data   Contain the malicious files
Sandbox capability            Investigate the malicious files
Threat Intelligence           Eliminate the threat
============================= ===============================

Cisco AMP provides both EPP and EDR capabilities

Justifying Endpoint Patching
----------------------------

Keeping Endpoints up to Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Exploit vulnerabilities in system code or software code
-  Flaw allowed malicious actors to spoof digital certificate
-  Microsoft released a patch that fixed the flaw
