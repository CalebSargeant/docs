3. Using Multi-Factor Authentication
====================================

Multi-Factor Authentication
---------------------------

Single Factore Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Strong passwords are essential for security, but they have their
limitations.

**Provide Authentication** Passwords determine the person is who they
say they are.

**Single Factor** Passwords are only one factor, even if they are
complex and strong.

**Can be Compromised** Complex passwords donâ€™t eliminate being
compromised.

Multifactor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Multiple forms of authentication
-  Common Access Card (CAC)

   -  Physical device with chip and picture

-  Both CAC and password required for access
-  End-user would notice the CAC missing
-  Token with numbers that change every minute
-  Biometric features such as fingerprint or facial recognition
-  Consumers use multifactor authentication for additional security
-  Multilayer authentication is when the same factor is presented
   multiple times
-  Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a subset of multifactor
   authentication

DUO Security
------------

-  Cloud-based and on-premises multifactor authentication
-  Application that runs on smart devices Provides real-time alerts if
   password was compromised
-  Posture assessment
-  Single sign-on
-  Time-based restrictions
