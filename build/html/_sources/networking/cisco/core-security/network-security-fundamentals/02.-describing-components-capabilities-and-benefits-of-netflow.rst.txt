Describing Components, Capabilities, & Benefits of NetFlow
==========================================================

NetFlow Introduction
--------------------

What is Flow?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Information about the packets that traverse a router
-  Source and destination, ports, and the protocol being used

NetFlow
~~~~~~~

-  Created by Cisco
-  Netflow records stored in NetFlow cache
-  NetFlow records are small
-  Receipt of the traffic
-  Flows are unidirectional
-  Send to stealthwatch for analytics
-  User ports
-  Data center
-  VPNs
-  Internet Edge
-  Sample traffic

   -  May miss important packets

Netflow Benefits
----------------

-  Use existing hardware

   -  Dont need to purchase expensive network tap infrastructure

-  Network as a sensor
-  Gain insight about the traffic using the network

   -  Use information to make strategic business decisions

Aditional NetFlow Benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Use NetFlow information to make design changes
-  Test different changes and verify the traffic is being shaped the way
   you want to
-  Use NetFlow to troubleshoot issues and find root cause

NetFlow Secuirty Benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Quickly identify suspicious traffic
-  Concerning Port (the type of traffic doesnâ€™t match the services)
-  Wrong Industry (traffic flowing to sites that your organisation
   doesnt do buisness with)
-  Embargoed Countries (Traffic leaves the country your org resides in
   destined to an embargoed country)

Network as an Enforcer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Integrate with different Cisco tools
-  Segment traffic
-  Switch can apply ACLs dynamically

NetFlow Versions & Flow Standards
---------------------------------

NetFlow Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Netflow v1:**

-  Limited to IPv4 without network masks
-  Obsolete

**Netflow v5:**

-  Can collect IP ToS, ASN, network masks

**Netflow v9:**

-  Template based

   -  Can add or remove infor without rewriting code

NetFlow v9
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Template is included in NetFlow packet
-  Stealthwatch will know what info to expect
-  UDP 2055
-  127 different field types

Flexible NetFlow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Different cache buckets
-  Can have different data stored in different caches
-  Allow for users to create their own fields of what to collect on

IPFIX
~~~~~

-  IETF standard based on NetFlow v9
-  Supports templates
-  UDP 4739

Configuring NetFlow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Create flow record
-  Create flow exporter
-  Create flow monitor
-  Apply flow monitor to interface

Cisco Stealthwatch
------------------

Stealthwatch
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Normalize traffic and find anomalies

   -  Spike in traffic
   -  Suspicious IPs and ports
   -  Malware in encrypted traffic

-  Concern index
-  Associate users to flow
-  Flow generated for all traffic

**Usages:**

-  PxGrid
-  Custom policies
-  Forensics
-  Generate reports

Stealthwatch Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  SMC

   -  Used to interact with flow and what analyses the flow

-  Flow collector

   -  Device that all network devices send flow to
   -  Associate Proxy information with flow data

-  Both flow collector and SMC are required for Stealthwatch

Aditional Stealthwatch Benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Flow sensor

   -  Generate flow for devices that cannot do it natively
   -  Can be used for layer 2 only traffic

-  UDP Director

   -  Aggregates flow and sends to stealthwatch
   -  Allows devices to only send flow to one destination
