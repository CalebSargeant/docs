===================================

Configuring Interfaces to Send and Receive Email
------------------------------------------------

Listeners and Host Access Tables
--------------------------------

Listeners
~~~~~~~~~

Listeners listen on the specified SMTP port for SMTP traffic

-  Public Listener

   -  Receives emails that are from other organizations with your org as
      the recipient
   -  Public listener will only accept emails if the recipient domain is
      explicitly defined

-  Private Listener

   -  Receives emails that are from your org with outside organizations
      as the recipient

-  Cisco sees over 300 billion emails daily
-  Determine the likely hood that a sender is malicious or legitimate

   -  IP Address of mail server
   -  Reverse DNS lookup
   -  Determine network owner
   -  Organization controlling mail servers should be using IP space

SMTP Deep Dive
--------------

SMTP 3-Digit Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  2 - Success - received, accepted and understood by the server
-  3 - Redirection - more information is required
-  4 - Temporary failure failure should be easily resolved
-  5 - Permanent failure - failure is unlikely to be resolved

SMTP Envelope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: text

   << 220 email.carvedrock.com SMTP
   >> HELO email.globomantics.com
   << 250 email.carvedrock.com
   >> MAIL FROM <kinda@globomantics.com>
   << 250 sender kinda@globomantics.com> ok
   >> RCPT TO: <angie@carvedrock.com>
   << 250 recipient <angie@carvedrock.com> ok

SMTP Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: text

   >> DATA
   << 354 go ahead
   >> From: kinda <kinda@globomantics.com>
   >> To: angie<angie@carvedrock.com>
   >> Subject: Hello?
   >> Date tue, 8 October 2019 21:28:30 -0800

X-headers can be used to send additional information in an email, but
they are not required

SMTP Body
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: text

   >> Pluralsight has some of the best training
   >> kinda
   << 250 ok
   >> QUIT
   << 221 email.carvedrock.com

Mail Flow Policies
------------------

Mail Flow Policy Behaviors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Relay - Used to forward outbound emails from Globomantics

   -  Relay is the only behavior that does not require an associated
      Recipient Access Table (RAT)

-  Accept - Used to accept incoming email from senders
-  Reject - SMTP connection is started, but 400 or 500 code is sent
-  TCP Refuse - No SMTP connection, sender may continue to try again
-  Continue - No definitive action, try to match another sender group

Integrating the ESA with LDAP and Recipient Access Table Deep Dive
------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrating ESA with LDAP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ESA will block emails if the recipient doesnâ€™t exist
-  Once LDAP is configured, by default all recipients will be verified

Place the more specific condition at the top, so it is matched before a
more generalized condition
