2. Explaining Common Threats & Protecting Humans from Attacks
=============================================================

Viruses, Trojans, & Other Malware
---------------------------------

Malware: Malicious Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Viruses
-  Trojans
-  Worms
-  Rootkits
-  Spyware
-  Adware
-  PUP

Viruses
~~~~~~~

-  Computer Program that copies itself
-  Spreads from one file to another

   -  Can spread from computer to computer

-  Executable code that attaches itself to another executable program

   -  .exe
   -  MS Office

-  Corrupts files and the OS

Spyware
~~~~~~~

-  Could be through a keylogger
-  Spies on victim
-  Can find other sensitive information

Trojan
~~~~~~

-  Designed to do a specific task
-  Can give attacker backdoor access to the victim’s machine
-  Can control multiple machines to use as an attack - DDoS
-  Ransomware: victim has to pay a ransom in order to access their files

RootKits
~~~~~~~~

-  Designed to go undetected
-  Can be installed in the computer’s kernal
-  Can control the entire computer

Worms
~~~~~

-  Replicate themselves
-  Not attached to a program
-  Attack a vulnerability of the target system

Adware
~~~~~~

-  Generates revenue

   -  Displays ads
   -  Pay-per-click

DoS Attacks & Man-in-the-middle Attacks
---------------------------------------

Denial of Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Degrades a system to prevent legitimate users access
-  Too much traffic for the system to process

Distributed DoS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Multiple machines doing a DoS to one server

Man-in-the-middle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Intercept client initial request to server
-  Sends a copy to original server
-  Server replies to Mitm
-  Mitm replies to client with copy
-  Can see contents of traffic intercepted by client to server
   communication
-  Client & server believe they’re talking correctly

Social Engineering & Phishing Attacks
-------------------------------------

Social Engineering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Perceived trust between attacker and another party
-  Could impersonate the victim in order to obtain sensitive information
-  Convincing victim they are a trusted authority
-  All future correspondence from them is legitimate
-  Emails could contain malicious links
-  Could provide the user with misinformation

Phishing
~~~~~~~~

-  Social engineering attack that uses electronic communications

**Types:**

-  Bulk Phishing

   -  Not a specific target (Generic)

-  Spear Phishing

   -  Specific target (a lot of research)

-  Whaling

   -  Spear phishing targeting high profile targets

-  Clone Phishing

   -  Attacker clones logos of legitimate services

**Methods:**

-  Link manipulation
-  Realistic websites

   -  www.titlecompany.updated-wiretransfer.com
   -  Take the victim to the attackers website

-  Website forgery

   -  JavaScript to make the address bar look legitimate

Endpoints Stopping Phishing
---------------------------

Train the Userbase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Verify domain
-  Ask if email makes sense
-  Check the data
-  Call to verify
-  Flag the email as spam
-  Call right away if attempt was successful

Computers Blocking Phishing Attempts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated
-  Cisco Advanced Phishing Protection

   -  Analyzes emails
   -  Takes configured action with malicious emails
   -  Can be sent to Cisco’s security experts for further analysis

Attacks Against Cloud Services
------------------------------

Dos & DDoS can still happen in cloud environments

Security Non-Profits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  CSA
-  OWASP

Data Breach
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Confidential info is stolen
-  Attacker targets less secure systems:

   -  Human error
   -  Application vulnerabilities
   -  Poor security practices

Insecure APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Allow for authorized data to be shared automatically
-  Embedding API with a threat
-  Stolen API keys
-  API has more access than it should

API Security Gateways
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Allow for single point of connection for API
-  Security features are built into API Security Gateways

   -  Not built into normal API Gateways

Account Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Promptly remove accounts and change passwords
-  Use MFA
