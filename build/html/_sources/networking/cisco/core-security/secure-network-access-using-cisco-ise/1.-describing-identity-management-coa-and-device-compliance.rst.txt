Describing Identity Management, CoA, and Device Compliance
==========================================================

What Is 802.1X?
---------------

-  802.1X allows for layer 2 network access control to be centrally
   managed.

**Supplicant** Software that is able to communicate with 802.1X. It is
installed on the device trying to gain network access.

**Authenticator** The Network Access Device (NAD) that the supplicant is
connecting to. The authenticator passes information between the
supplicant and the authentication server.

**Authentication Server** Centralized server responsible for
authenticating each device on the network, and authorizing what they are
allowed to do.

Benefits of 802.1X and Cisco ISE
--------------------------------

-  Users and devices are authenticated and authorized at a central
   location
-  No need to update switchports or Wi-Fi passwords
-  Can apply different settings to different devices

Network Security without 802.X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Port security and Wi-Fi passwords are not scalable

   -  Wi-Fi password changes need to be distributed
   -  Interfaces need to be updated with the correct MAC address
   -  MAC addresses are easily spoofed

-  Administrative overhead

Device Profiling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Cisco ISE is able to probe devices
-  Determines what type of device it is

   -  Operating system and version
   -  Smart devices or computers

-  Can start to use profiling information to make authorization
   decisions

Device Posturing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  NAC agents installed on device collect information:
-  Antivirus signatures, security patches, registry settings,
   applications installed, etc.

**Unknown**

-  No NAC agent installed or running
-  VLAN would only allow NAC agent to be installed

**Non-Compliant**

-  Device doesn’t meet minimum requirements
-  VLAN would only allow for updates and correct settings to be
   installed

**Compliant**

-  Device meets minimum requirements
-  Settings applied would be based off of policy

Change of Authorization (CoA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Allows authorization of device to change after the initial RADIUS
   access-accept message
-  RFC 3576 & 5176

Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Allows network users to bring their personal devices to join the
   network
-  Security checks of these devices is done via ISE

   -  Administrators don’t need to manually complete

-  Can be a tiered approach

Guest Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Allows visitors to quickly gain access without the need to have a
   permanent account created

**Non-Authenticated**

-  Guest is unknown
-  Click through a portal to gain access

**Authenticated**

-  Guest would register
-  Can apply different policies to different types of guests

   -  Long-term Contractor VS. Daily Visitor

-  Utilize Central Web Server

Different EAP Types
-------------------

**Native EAP** Passes information immediately

**Tunneled EAP** Forms an outer tunnel, then uses a Native EAP method as
the inner EAP tunnel

Native EAP Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  EAP-MD5

   -  Uses MD5 hash to pass credentials and other sensitive information.

-  EAP-TLS

   -  Uses certificates on both supplicant and authentication server to
      establish TLS tunnel. Both sides of tunnel are able to
      authenticate each other.

-  EAP-MSCHAPV2

   -  Uses Microsoft’s implementation of CHAP to pass Active Directory
      credentials.

-  EAP-GTC

   -  Similar to EAP-MSCHAPv2, but allows authentication with any
      identity store not just Active Directory.

Both EAP-MSCHAPv2 and EAP-GTC need to be inside of a tunneled EAP
protocol to work with Cisco ISE.

Two Different EAP Tunnels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Protected EAP (PEAP)**

-  Created by Microsoft
-  Creates a TLS tunnel only using the authentication server’s
   certificate
-  Commonly used with EAP-MSCHAPV2 as the inner tunnel
-  Can also be used with EAP-TLS or EAP-GTC,

**EAP-FAST**

-  Created by Cisco
-  Allows for faster wireless roaming between access points. Uses
   Protected Access Cookies (PACs)
-  Creates a TLS tunnel only using the authentication server’s
   certificate
-  EAP-MSCHAPV2 is a popular inner protocol
-  EAP-GTC can be used to connect to non-Microsoft identity stores
-  EAP-TLS is popular because it allows for EAP Chaining
-  EAP chaining is where both the device and user credentials are being
   passed at the same time

MAC Authentication Bypass & WebAuth
-----------------------------------

-  Uses MAC Address to authenticate - must be added to identity store
   using ISE
-  No supplicant - EAPol sent every 30sec per 3 attempts to see if
   device is 802.1x capable
-  Authenticator assumes that device doesn’t support 802.1x and puts MAC
   Address in RADIUS Access-Request message

Drawbacks of MAB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Weaker posture and requires more administrative overhead
-  Each MAC address has to be in ISE
-  Not difficult for an attacker to spoof the MAC address of a
   legitimate device

Web Authentication (WebAuth)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Local WebAuth (LWA) and Central WebAuth (CWA)
-  Allows user to enter username and password to provide identification
-  Additional policies can assigned based off of the identification

LWA Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Local WebAuth                     | Local WebAuth with a Centralized  |
|                                   | Portal                            |
+===================================+===================================+
| Portal hosted on the              | Authenticator redirects user to   |
| authenticator                     | central server to enter           |
|                                   | credentials                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Authenticator generates RADIUS    | Portal sends credentials back to  |
| Access-Request message containing | authenticator using either HTTP   |
| username and password             | Post or hidden I-frame            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Authenticator then generates      |
|                                   | RADIUS Access-Request message     |
|                                   | containing username and password  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| The authenticator is generating   |                                   |
| the RADIUS Access-Request message |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

CWA Process
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Device without a supplicant connects to the network
-  802.1X times out, authenticator generates a MAB Access-Request
   message
-  ISE responds with RADIUS Message
-  Within RADIUS messages is a URL Redirection to portal located on ISE
-  User enters credentials, and they are stored in ISE and tied to the
   MAB session
-  ISE issues a CoA reauth message, causing a new MAB request to be sent
-  MAB request contains the same session ID as the first request
-  ISE associates new MAB request to the user’s credentials that were
   previously entered
-  ISE now has all information needed to perform policy lookup and issue
   final authorization

Introduction to Cisco TrustSec
------------------------------

-  Tag devices based on their business purpose
-  All traffic from the device will include this tag
-  Use Security/Scalable Group Tag (SGT)
-  Policies can then be created to shape traffic between devices with
   different SGTs

TrustSec Benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Keeping up with ACLs can be administratively cumbersome

   -  IP space for each scenario would need to be carved out
   -  ACLs would need to be created accordingly to match each scenario

-  TrustSec allows for devices to have the same SGT regardless of where
   they are
-  Policies would be configured centrally, and dynamically pushed to all
   network devices in the network

   -  Configured in a matrix, so it is easy to see which SGTs do or
      don’t have access to each other
