Docker
======

A container is more closely related to an executable than it is to a virtual machine, because everything needed to run the application code and everything else the application needs is packaged together.

A docker image is like a template. A docker container is a running instance of the template. Each micro-service, or application, is placed in their own container.

Although containerization strips everything down to the bare-minimum needed for an application to run and is called the next evolution in virtual machines, it's more than that. Each container is actually called a process and runs as an executable. A container is, therefore, not a virtual machine.
